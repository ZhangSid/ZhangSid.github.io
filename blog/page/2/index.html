  <div class="entry-content"><p>by Julie D. Stern</p>

<p>June 28, 2012</p>

<p>Eric Klinenberg, author of Going Solo: The Extraordinary Rise and Surprising Appeal of Living Alone, discusses how anoutmoded image of singletons, such as the ruggedindividualist shown on screen, is being replaced by an image of active, connected singles who contribute tocommunity vitality.</p>

<p>The rise in living alone is “the biggest modern social change that we’ve yet to name or identify,” said Eric Klinenberg, professor of sociology at New York University. He examined the effect this change is having on cities and suburbs in a keynote presentation at a ULI Terwilliger Center for Housing forum on June 21 in Washington, D.C.</p>

<p>Klinenberg, author of Going Solo: The Extraordinary Rise and Surprising Appeal of Living Alone (The Penguin Press, 2012), uses the term “singleton” to differentiate those who live alone from unmarried “singles,” many of whom live in households with family members or others.</p>

<p>He argued that this trend does not mean what many people assume. Ourold perceptions about those who live alone—that they are sick, neurotic, immoral, and/or lonely—are simply wrong, he said. In fact, he noted, people who live alone are more likely than married people totake advantage of <strong>urban amenities</strong> , to go out at night, to attend public events and engage in other activities that “animate the streets.”</p>

<p>They also are more likely to volunteer with <strong>civic organizations</strong>. “These are not selfish, self-involved, narcissistic people who are not participating incollective life. We have to change our image of who singletons are. Clearly they are a force in cities today.”</p>

<p>Klinenberg presented theintriguing statistics that 27.6 percent of all U.S. households consist of people living alone (compared with fewer than 10 percent in 1950), and that this ispredominantly an urban phenomenon (whereas until the 1950s it was a mostly rural one). In Washington, D.C., and Manhattan, for example, nearly half of all households are single-person ones (48 and 46 percent, respectively). “These arestaggering numbers, and theysay a lot about how we live today,” he added.</p>

<p>Who are these singletons, what types of housing choices are they making, and what will these choices mean for thehousing industry? During the course of his research, Klinenberg came toview the phenomenon of living alone as asocial experiment rather than a social problem. “Why do the most privileged people on earth use their resources to separate from one another?” he asked. The answer, he proposed, is a reflection of values that many view as inherently American: freedom, personal control, and self realization—as well as (and not necessarily paradoxically)both solitude and connection with others.</p>

<p>The rising economic status of women, widespread prosperity, and the “rise of the welfare state” also havedriven up rates of living alone. (Many European nations, including Sweden, Norway, Germany, the Netherlands, Great Britain, and France, have even higher percentages of singletons than the United States.) Yet, he noted, a catastrophic economic situation or thedemise of social security and other support systems could dramaticallyshift the trend.</p>

<p>Klinenberg cited four<strong>primary factors</strong> that are playing roles in this trend and that have broad implications for the development industry:</p>

<p> <strong>Women’s Economic Independence</strong></p>

<p>Single women today represent about 20 percent of all home buyers; they are twice as likely to buy a home as single men.</p>

<p> <strong>The Communications Revolution</strong></p>

<p>Being home alone today means something very different than it did in the past. “We are creating new kinds of sociability; social media are connecting people in new ways,” he suggested, arguing that the best evidence to date implies that the heaviest users of social media also are “the heaviest users of face time”; they are more likely to spend time with others.</p>

<p> <strong>The Rise of Cities—and of Neighborhoods within Cities</strong></p>

<p>As many as 70 percent of the households in some urban neighborhoods consist of a single person. Klinenberg argued thatsuch neighborhoods benefit the entire city by offering the cafés, restaurants, bars, active sidewalks, and other amenities that result in “a booming public life.” They are the “places where we all like to go,” he said.</p>

<p><strong>The Longevity Revolution</strong></p>

<p>More people also are aging alone than ever before. This has clear implications for continuum-of-care retirement communities andassisted-living facilities, places where people can have their own “home” and be close tocompanions, service providers, and amenities.</p>

<p>“Living alone is a hugely significant social change that we misunderstand at our peril,” Klinenberg said, noting that the cities and suburbs that recognize and accept this trend will be more successful than those that do not.</p>

<p>What types of housing attracts singletons? Klinenberg described a residential complex in Stockholm, Sweden, (which he called “the world capital of living alone”) for people 45 and older. The complex looks a lot like many high-end, amenity-rich buildings in New York City, featuring relatively small residential units but a multitude of amenities, including a large health club, a coffee bar, party rooms, public lounge spaces and outdoor terraces.  <strong>It fosters community by requiring all residents to commit to helping with preparation of a shared meal several times a week.</strong></p>

<p>Projects like this, he proposed, could prove attractive to Americans who (sometimes to their surprise) find themselves aging alone—but who want to remain connected with others.</p>

<p>How this trend will play out in housing for younger age groups, and in inner-ring suburbs that could become more popular among young singleton professionals depends in part on whether municipalities can resolve zoning issues and overcome opposition from existing residents. Some zoning requirements, along with community opposition, can make it difficult or impossible to build smaller-scale residential units and the commercial amenities that appeal to people who live alone.</p>

<p>“I think that’s a real issue,” said Klinenberg. “There are a lot of ideas about how to build smaller residential units that connect people to a bigger world, and I hope we can have some good conversations about that.”</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p> <em>c8t1</em></p>

<p>Children are the future. Therefore, early childhood education is the utmost priority on the importance list concerned by parents, schools and states. When it comes to who should be responsible for educating children into useful adults, there is an ongoing debate. Many advocate that comparing with school education, parenting is of more significance in this aspect.</p>

<p>Such beliefs are not groundless. Above all, parents are the first teacher to children. Their ways of thinking and behaviour decide what their children will be like in the future. As is reported, a child&rsquo;s basic skill of communication and language is formed in the first three years in his/ her life, and this indicates that any verbal and physical movement parents made in these three years will help to build a child&rsquo;s personality and a basic concept about people and the outside world. Moreover, the mindset of being grateful and respectful to good deeds and people are taught by parents. When parents take care of their older parents at home, their ways of helping the elderly have a great reflection on children&#8217; mind, which do lead a young to a lifelong way of showing respect to the old and the needed. Also, the ability of love and being loved is imparted by parents in a tender manner. A kid learn this ability by feeling the most earnest love to himself or herself from parents, and they start getting the importance of love and being loved. A person who can behave appropriately, respect and love others is believed to be a valuable member of society.</p>

<p>However, some still argue that rather than parenting, schooling in fact plays a more influential role in children&#8217; development. In their opinion, a child is supposed to obtain theoretical knowledge of a range of subjects and the ability to win the fierce competition among peers by attending normal schooling.Success it might lead children to, there is hardly any evidence linking schooling to the future of being a good community member in a child. No matter how successful a person could be, financially or academically, there is still a high possibility that a well-school-educated person finally turn out to be a selfish adult who has no basic passion towards human being and community. There are too many examples to illustrate  a higher education qualification dose not guarantee a well manner or behavior in that person. In comparison to parenting, which is widely thought as a necessary and sufficient condition in the process of educating children into valuable adults, schooling is believed only a necessary condition at its best.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>In January, Japanese Health Minister Hakuo Yanagisawa visited the city of Matsue to talk to party members about the falling birth rate.</p>

<p> <em>Arresting the decline</em>  would be difficult, he said, because &ldquo;the number of birth-giving machines and devices is fixed&rdquo;.</p>

<p>&ldquo;All we can ask for is for them to do their best per head,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>Mr Yanagisawa&rsquo;s comments did not go down well. Womenreacted angrily to his choice of words, while the oppositionaccused him of blaming women for the fertility crisis.</p>

<p>But the episode didhighlight one thing. Government measuresaimed at boosting fertility have so far failed to <strong>deliver the desired rise.</strong></p>

<p>So what exactlyis behind Japan&rsquo;s low birth rate?</p>

<p><strong>&lsquo;Work or kids&rsquo;</strong></p>

<p> <strong>Across the developed world</strong> , as a general trend, women are working more and marrying later.</p>

<p>But compare Japan with Sweden, for example. More Swedish women work and they marry later, yet the country&rsquo;s birth rate is far healthier. So Japan&rsquo;s troubles cannotbe attributed to these two factors alone.</p>

<p>In Japan, peopleflagged up three separate issuesas obstacles to child-rearing &ndash; <strong>money worries, the problems of working and having a family, and a lack of support for mothers.</strong></p>

<p>&ldquo;Everyonehas the impression that raising a child is very expensive,&rdquo; one Tokyo student said. But many young couples do not have much money.</p>

<p>Pay is often linked to age, while adisproportionate number of young people and women are employed<strong>on</strong>poorly-paid temporary contracts. Child allowances are low, while housing and education costs are high.</p>

<p>The financial situation for young couples can be even harder because many women give up work when they have children &#8211; sometimes reluctantly.</p>

<p>Some workplaces are unwilling to keep jobs open for mothers-to-be, who can come under both direct and indirect pressure to leave.</p>

<p>In small and medium-sized firms, says Dr Kuniko Inoguchi, former minister for gender equality and social affairs, around 70% of pregnant women end up quitting.</p>

<p>For those women who do return to work, things can be hard.</p>

<p>Many struggle to find affordable child care facilities that can keep infants all day. Others discover that although they have jobs, <strong>they bear no resemblance to the ones they left and promotionis no longer a possibility.</strong></p>

<p>&ldquo;Many women want to work and have kids,&rdquo; said Mitsuko Kamaya, a housewife.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But <strong>it&rsquo;s still the case that</strong> it is either work or kids. Women feel that they have to throw one dream or the other away,&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If there was a system that guaranteed women could get back to work, I think more would feel secure enough to have kids.&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>Hard work</strong></p>

<p>Then there are the practicalities of raising children.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Families used to live with all the generations together,&rdquo; said one Tokyo pensioner.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That was good for everybody, as there were more people around to provide support.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In rural areas where this is still common, birth rates are above the national average. But many young couples live in cramped city apartments far from relatives and when babies are born, husbands tend not to compensate for the lack of family assistance.</p>

<p>According to a lifestyle survey in 2001, married men only spent about 30 minutes each day on household tasks or with their children.</p>

<p><strong>This is partly down to traditional attitudes</strong> &#8211; Japanese men tend not to cook, clean or change nappies. <strong>But another problem is a culture of long working hours, followed by compulsory after-work socialising.</strong></p>

<p>&ldquo;My colleague&rsquo;s wife has just had a baby, but he has to work until 11 o&#8217;clock every night,&rdquo; said one Tokyo businessman.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He only ever sees the baby when it&rsquo;s asleep.&rdquo;</p>

<p> <strong>So child-rearing can, in some cases, prove a lonely and exhausting solo experience for mothers, many of whom then decide to stick with just one child.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Social change</strong></p>

<p>Osaka City has the second lowest birth rate in the country, behind the capital, Tokyo. In 2005 it stood at 1.15 births per woman, well below the national average of 1.26.</p>

<p>In recent years, officials there have worked hard to introduce family-friendly policies. There are now more day care places available for children of working mothers and the facilities are staying open longer each day.</p>

<p>Primary schools are running after-school programmes for children whose parents both work, while stay-at-home mothers can now use a pay-per-hour baby-sitting service when they need some time to themselves.</p>

<p>But the birth rate is not rebounding.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We can try topublicise the idea that having a child is a good experience, and work to create an environment in which women feel secure enough to have one,&rdquo; said Yasuko Baba of the city&rsquo;s Children and Youth Bureau.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But we can&rsquo;t say &lsquo;please have a child&rsquo;. Ultimately it is up to them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Dr Inoguchi says the government needs to spend more on helping young families. But she says there also needs to be social change so that both men and women have a better balance between work and family.</p>

<p>And the population crisis is helping to highlight where the problems lie.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This very dramatic changing demography and the alarming view that we may not be able to sustain the greying of the population is now leading to &#8211; belatedly and reluctantly &#8211; the mainstreaming of gender issues,&rdquo; she said.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Facebook started out as a way for like minded students to share their life experiences and stay in touch. But are social networking sites enabling interaction or reducing it to a escapist experience,displacing real interaction in favour of an alternative reality?</p>

<p>To try and answer what is anexistential question, at best, it is necessary to look at the positive and negative impacts of FaceBook on it&#8217;suser community, gleaned from various sources interviewed by the BBC in &ldquo;Online networking &lsquo;harms health&rsquo;&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Social networking can enrich social lives for those separated from family and friends by long distances, bringing them together despite the physical separation. This has recentlycome to light in the number of people in the armed forces using YouTube, FaceBook and Twitter to stay in touch.</p>

<p>Online communication can help those with dysfunctional syndromes achieve a level of social interaction previously difficult or impossible. For some people, interaction with crowds <strong>is made easier</strong>  if they do not actually feel thephysical immersion.</p>

<p>Such sites also provide thoseisolated by disability or environment with a rich and fulfilling social life. For anyone who is unable to leave their own house, social networking has provided a great way to get in touch with people who have similar issues, as well as allowing them to stay in touch with existing networks of friends.</p>

<p>Finally, social networking sites can bring people together with varying backgrounds who might otherwise never have met, and then encourage them to extend that experience into real world social functions.</p>

<p><strong>Negative Impact of FaceBook</strong></p>

<p><strong>Electronic interaction</strong> displaces the social interaction, <strong>keeping people apart</strong> – it is so convenient that peoplelack the drive to actually interact face to face. People aresocial animals,  <strong>in the main</strong> , and removing that pillar can actually affect their social development, especially if started at a young age.</p>

<p>It also changes the way people interact, possibly producing changes that will eventually affect theevolution of social interaction. The lack of face to face communication undermines skills such as reading body language and other indirect communication facilities.</p>

<p>Mass electronic communication may lead to alower quality of social interaction due to thesheer number of participants; the background level of gossip is likely to be higher than in face to face interactions. There&rsquo;s also the inference that online information has less value somehow than real world information, although the same could be said of water cooler office gossip.</p>

<p><strong>On Balance : How Should FaceBook Be Used?</strong></p>

<p> <em>As with other enabling technologies</em> , such as email, web search engines, and online publishing outlets like Wikipedia, the <strong>overall message is that</strong>, <strong>in moderation, Facebook and other networking sites are a good thing.</strong></p>

<p>They let people connect, whether they knew each other in the first place or not – staying in touch or making new friends. Yes, there are potential drawbacks in the form of very public cases where such friendships have degenerated into something more sinister, but the positives far outweigh them.</p>

<p> <em>Success stories include various marriages, business deals, partnerships, and other very encouraging<strong>endorsements</strong> of virtual communication as a form of social interaction.</em></p>

<p>However,relying exclusively on electronic communication for social interaction is likely todamage rather than enrich lives. Everyone, at some point, with very few exceptions, needs the face to face contact in order tomaintain their social skills.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p> <em>rubric: what are the causes and solutions of youth unemployment?</em></p>

<p>Youth unemployment is a chronic issue. This social problem is not a single-cause case but a result from many social forces, especially in economy, culture and the disproportion in higher education arrangement of curriculum. This essay will analyze the major causes behind this trend and highlight some responsible solutions.</p>

<p>Many fresh graduates take graduation as the time being unemployed, while the increasing rate of youth unemployment reconfirms this fear. With the recent break out of economic recession, first in the USA, then in Japan and Europe, this trend has been exacerbated. Under such circumstance, many companies started to cut off its man power as well as limit the number of newly recruited employees. This makes it hard for an experienced worker to keep his or her job, let alone new graduates finding a position in such an economic hardship. Also, it is long been discussed that higher education fails to meet the need of providing the society and labor market with students who master no only theoretical knowledge but practical skills. As a result, the average performance of young graduates at work is relatively unsatisfying, which leads to an avoidance of recruiting first-year graduates in many companies. And this is another factor which intensifies the situation of youth unemployment.</p>

<p>According to those causes analyzed above, several measures should be put into effect in the near future. First of all, an economic recovery is the surefire cure for this situation, which asks for the very effort from governments. Governors can draw a strategy after through study of the job market stimulation policy enacted by Roosevelt-introducing big infrastructure programs to underdeveloped area&#8211;to consume a big number of labors. Secondly, the insufficiency of higher education should be filled as soon as possible, including opening courses about the office manner and dress code in certain company culture, to compensate the scarcity of work experience in students. Again, more connections should be bridged between students and companies. Take Holland for example, it mandates students to accomplish the target of taking internship during college period. This method allows students to have a better acquaintance with the way how a company is operated and how to get along with colleagues in office.</p>

<p>In conclusion, youth unemployment is a social issue which is resulted from many social changes. If the solutions identified above are implemented, the situation of this issue will be largely improved.</p>

<p> <em>Some people think that pollution and damage of environment are resulting from a country&rsquo;s developing and becoming richer, and this is hard to be avoided. To what extent do you agree or disagree?</em></p>

<p>With the economic boom,the pollution and environmental degradation are becoming increasingly serious. Some people argue that this is the inevitable outcome of a country’s economic development. Personally, I am of this opinion.</p>

<p>The industrial development has thus far consumed a variety of non-renewable resources and produced pollution. Due to industrialization, non-renewable resources, including fossil fuel and other raw materials are consumed at an alarming rate. It is universally acknowledged that these resources are limited and once being depleted, they would not be restored within a short time. More worse is that the consumption of natural resources produces pollutions and it is proved that the consumption of fossil fuel is the main reason behind the ever-severe air pollution.</p>

<p>And until now, human race still is far away from the balance between development and ecosystem sustainability. The anti-pollution measures are futile in front of the irreversible eager of developing economy; the government compromises to the commercial benefits brought by highly-polluted industries, including energy industry and chemistry industry; people hold the view that “environmental conservation is second to economic development”. This shows that economic development has driven people ahead, leaving environmental protection behind.</p>

<p>However, it should be noted that some countries have succeeded in both economic and environmental development. For example, Swiss and some north European countries, such as Norway, have set good examples for other nations about how to develop economy and protect the environment at the same time. But compared with the typical modes of development in most countries, these examples are just some exceptions.</p>

<p>In conclusion, I believe that the economic development is thriving at the price of environment and this is an inevitable trend. However, people should never give up the effort of maintaining environment while developing economy for this effort will certainly pay back when the country is financially and technologically capable of tackling environmental problems.</p>

<p>这篇文章典型的唠叨型……不过，刚好，观点很多。随便捡一两个来拓展就好了。</p>

<p>&#8211;by John Henry Newman</p>

<p>节选之：</p>

<p>But a university training is the great ordinary means to a great but ordinary end; it aims at raising the intellectual tone of society, at cultivating the public mind, at purifying the national taste, at giving enlargement and sobriety to the idea of the age, at facilitating the exercise of political power, and refining the intercourse of private life.</p>

<p>It is the education which gives a man a clear, conscious views of his own opinions and judgments, a truth in developing them, an eloquence in expressing them, and a force in urging them. It teaches him to see things as they are, to go right to the point, to disentangle a skein of thought, to detect what is sophistical, and to discard what is irrelevant. It prepares him to fill any post with credit, and to master any subject with facility.</p>

<p>It shows him how to accommodate himself to others, how to throw himself into their stat of mind, how to bring before them his own, how to influence them, how to come to an understanding with them, and how to bear with them. He is at home in any society; he has common ground with every class; he knows when to speak and when to be silent; he is also to converse; he is able to listen; he can ask a question pertinently, and gain a lesson seasonably, where he has nothing to impart himself; he is ever ready, yet never in the way; he is a pleasant companion, and a comrade you can depend upon; he knows when to be serious and when to trifle, and he has a sure tact which enables him to trifle with gracefulness and to be serious with effect. He has the repose of a mind which lives in itself, while it lives in the world, and which serves him in public, and supports him in retirement, without which good fortune is but vulgar, and with which failure and disappointment have a charm.</p>

<p>The art which tends to make a man all this, is in the object which it pursues as useful as the art of wealth or the art of health, though it is less susceptible of method, and less tangible, less certain, less complete in its result.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>这篇文章关于为什么大学应该教授更多与工作相关的知识。阅读之后可以找到很多关于教育类考题大学教育的目的的词伙。</p>

<p>by Susannah Jackson</p>

<p>Last week Education secretary Michael Gove asked some of the top universities in the UK to set A-level exams, amid fears that tens of thousands of teenagers<strong>are under-prepared</strong> when they start their degrees.</p>

<p>This means that 24 of the most academically competitive universities in the UK will be allowed to choose the content of the syllabus and questions on A-level exams.</p>

<p>But is this really what students need? It might be true that school exams don’t prepare people for university but similarly, university does not prepare its students for working life.</p>

<p>This year, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) revealed that the rate of unemployment among 21 year-old university graduates<strong>is roughly equal to</strong> that of 18 year-old school leavers, at 25 per cent and 26 per cent, respectively.</p>

<p>It is apparent that the university system is not doing enough to<strong>equip students with the skills they need to succeed</strong>. So, before the universities start to put their curriculum into schools they need to take a look at their own relevance to the workplace.</p>

<p>To do this they need to talk to businesses, find out the qualities that employers are looking for in their next star recruit and then work at fostering these attributes in their students.</p>

<p>Employers are looking for new starters to <strong>not just tick the boxes on a job description but to have the ambition to succeed in their own careers and the commercial outlook to grow businesses.</strong></p>

<p>These are <strong>qualities</strong> that need to be taught from school onwards, and to <strong>get the curriculum right</strong>, schools and universities<strong>need to be working with businesses at the very roots of the education system.</strong></p>

<p><strong>This approach has been embraced</strong> by our client Gazelle, a group of Further Education colleges that are bringing<strong>entrepreneurship</strong> into the heart of their operations. By working with some of the UK’s leading entrepreneurs, including Luke Johnson, Doug Richard, Lara Morgan and Will King, they are inviting business leaders in to advise on and inform the way they prepare students for the world of business.</p>

<p>There is an argument that this needs to<strong>happen across the entire education system</strong>.</p>

<p>The job-creators, the universities and government need to work together to provide the next generation with <strong>courses that will prepare and skill them</strong> for the 21st century<strong>workplace</strong>.</p>
